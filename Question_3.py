# Question 3 	 

# You are again asked to find the minimum distance between two locations in terms of number of metres 
# and hence time for croc to travel. Croc speed is about 16 km/hr in water and 6km/hr on land. You are 
# required to specify the route in terms of the points travelled through on the path. Method minTime() 
# returns an array and a time value 

# As an extension, provide the number of crocs in a certain radius of a beach. Using this array of 
# locations, decide which is the optimum path segment between two points to insert a blockage 
# that would  make the beach safer, by increasing the time the maximum number of crocs would 
# have to travel.
