# Question 2 	 
 
# The engineers are now conducting a study on the benefit of constructing a croc barrier between
#  two existing locations. One important data that they need is a comparison between the current 
# distance between two locations using existing trails, and the hypothetical distance between two 
# locations if there is a blockage in the present shortest route between them. For instance a 
# monitoring device could be set up to alert if a croc passes and have a crew sent in. These devices 
# are expensive and risk being stolen, so we want the optimum place on the path to locate this. 

# For any two locations or group of locations, the higher the ratio between current distance and 
# hypothetical distance is, the more benefit can be obtained by building a  blockage along that 
# route. You should return the ratio of this improvement and the edge that will be blocked to 
# achieve this using method improveDistance()
