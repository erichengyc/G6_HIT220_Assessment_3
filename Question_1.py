# Question 1 
 
# To test the possibility of blocking route between two locations, the rangers have to perform an 
# exhaustive search on the path options between the two locations. This will involve them moving 
# between known sightings and along estuaries or shoreline to assess the ability for crocs to pass, 
# or possible ways to block their passage. 

# Your task is to devise an algorithm to determine the minimum cost of performing an exhaustive 
# search between two points, where this cost is proportional to ground covered. Also give the list 
# of locations that were chosen to segment the route in order to obtain this minimum cost. The 
# cost is estimated just in units (how many units of work time required). 
# Routine is computeCosting (location1, location 2).
